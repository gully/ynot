### Running the examples:

To run the examples:

```python
python train_Keck_NIRSPEC_order.py
```

There are currently no keyword arguments, with some hard-coded variables embedded in the example scripts.  The main tuning parameters are: `n_epochs`, GPUor CPU device selection, and whether or not to start training from a previously saved state or from scratch.
